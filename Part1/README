Makefile:
	The file empty.rs can be used to create an executable file named "empty".

empty.rs:
	A source code file containing a single main function with no code written inside

empty.trace:
	An existing file detailing all the system calls made in empty.rs. This file can be 
	reproduced with the command "strace -o empty.trace ./empty" so long as the executable
	"empty" is in the current directory
part1:
	A directory created using the "cargo" command. Contains a source code file making 4 system
	calls in part1 called "main.rs". Running the command "cargo build" while inside the part1
	directory will create an executable in Part1/part1/target/debug called "part1".

	A file called "part1.trace" exists in Part1/part1/target/debug which can be reproduced using
	the command "strace -o part1.trace ./part1" so long as the executable named "part1" is also in
	the directory.
